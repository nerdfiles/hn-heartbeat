#HN-Heartbeat

A 'heartbeat' web application for Hacker News members' karma.

##Requirements

###Overview

Grab the points received from user's submissions - https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=neilkelty - and from their comments - https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=neilkelty - and then graph the data out.

###Expected Views

1. On the landing page, user enters their HN ID
2. On the main page, user is presented with a line chart showing their Karma score over time (3 lines - 1 for karma from submissions, 1 for karma from comments, and the combined total).
3. Then just display out below the chart a nicely displayed list of each submission, comment, date, and karma points.
